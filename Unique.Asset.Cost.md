# Title: Unique Asset Cost a Hindrance to Adoption

As features are added to the RVN BC the possible use cases greatly increase.  With the addition of messaging the abilities outlined 
in https://github.com/MangoFarmAssets/rips/blob/master/rip-0011.mediawiki , the functionality and possible use cases of the RVN 
unique asset have astronomically increased.  The cost of ta unique asset, 5 RVN, however can put a great financial burden on many 
use case scenarios. 

I propose greatly reducing the cost of issuing a unique asset, possibly down to the cost of the transaction.

The lowering of the cost to issue a unique asset will encourage more use cases and as a result increase the value of the RVN BC.

Some of the use case where this would play a large factor:
1.	Package tracking.  Added cost to each package would be much to high.

2.	 Membership token.  Would FB have 2 billion + users if everyone had to pay $0.15 to join?

3.	Personalized receipts. Could greatly increase the automation of marketplace functions.  If an artist wanted to limit the # of 
prints using RIP 11 to say 10,000.  Cost could be a problem.

4.	Address ID for any mass adaption function.  If “any needed function” wanted to issue a million+ personalized address on the 
RVN BC using the Unique Asset function, cost could be a problem.

5.	The cost of the Unique Token leaves many function accessible to deep pockets and there for makes it difficult for many grassroots 
and cypherpunk type organizations to access the functionality.

There are many more cases that could benefit from lower unique asset cost.

Possible down side is clutter.  I do not know how this might affect the speed and function of the BC when we have 28 billion unique 
assets on the chain.
