# Legitimization of transactions

Here is another way of utilizing tokens for legitimizing transactions: donations to a charity

1. CEO burns 500 Ravencoin (RVN) to create an asset which represents a charity (e.g.WISDOM_OF_RAVENS_GENERAL). Then he creates multiple sub-assets which represent 
crowd-funding items with a quantity of xyz tokens each and they must not be replicated - replicas point to someone trying to commit fraud. 
If replicas are to be found, the originals can be retrieved from the RVN asset explorer to invoke a case against fraudulent actions for example. 

2. CEO sends each trustee one token to legitimate their position as trustee => truthful statement about who owns what (e.g. a right). 
That trustee is allowed to receive donations now.
If a non-legitimate entity is to be caught in receiving donations, a case against fraudulent actions can be invoken.

3. If the CEO commits fraudulent actions by burning „WISDOM_OF_RAVENS_GENERAL“  then this action can also be tracked in the asset explorer - 
the CEO won‘t get away with all the funds
In case his trustees decide to burn the asset then they will be subject to fraudulent actions.
