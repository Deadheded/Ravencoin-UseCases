# Wallet widget for assets.  

A small wallet application that can create an address and hold an asset compliant with 
https://github.com/MangoFarmAssets/rips/blob/master/rip-0011.mediawiki    

The application could be loaded on computer, phones, Xbox, Playstation, Xfinity X1 box, Rocu, smart door locks, or any device that 
needs to restrict or add access to almost digital access.  The address could be recovered using the 12 word key but could only one 
could exist at a time.  This would provide proof of identity for the device.  This could be used in a number of ways.

1.  Access to subscriptions sites on the web.

2.  Subscription services such as Netflis, Hulu, Rocu, ect... to stop account sharing.  Accounts could have a limited number of addresses.

3.  Employer network access.  Small to large companies could manage access to their in house network.

4.  Home automation and secuity access.  Owner could limit access by sending or changing allowed addresses.

5.  Smart locks that checked for the access asset on your phone.  This could be used for services like Walmart grocery delivery or 
    other service or devivery access to your home or office.
    
6.  Car locks, building or condo access, safes, storage areas, there are a lot of uses.  

This would be the client side app.  You would need a server side that checked the hash name, the address and the BC to confirm
idenity.

This also may have many licensing opportunities of which a portion should go back to further development of RVN BC.
