# The Raven News Wire: A journalist to news outlets economic network.

A wire service, similar to the AP.  Journalists from independents to large news organizations post their articles to a closed marketplace.
If a news outlet wishes to run a story they could purchase the headline and teaser for a small fee ($10 ???) and run that on their site.

If a consumer clicked to read the article it would link back to the original creatorâ€™s site so that they could enjoy the advertisement 
revenue.  

If a news outlet wised to run the story on their own site and keep the advertising revenue they could pay a larger fee ($500 ???) to 
have the entire article.

This would reward popular journalism and drive more revenue to smaller outlets and independent journalists. 

Content would be hosed on IPFS and delivered via RVN messaging function.  The asset transactions coul be used for billing.
