# My Dream RVN Wallet
I envision this wallet on a phone or PC.  

The current function of the RVN Android wallet with its ability to brows to IPFS links plus the current functions of the PC QT wallet, 
creation of assets, and attaching of IPFS hash to both asset creation and asset transaction messages.

I would like to have the additional functions:

1.	 BIP 44 support.  Blondfrogs is current working on this.

2.	The ability to browse to IPFS attached to asset transactions as messages.

3.	The ability to create an address to certain specifications.  In order to use functions such as the ones outlined in 
    https://github.com/MangoFarmAssets/rips/blob/master/rip-0011.mediawiki
    
In addition to these functions there are three current 2nd layer projects that are only accessible via web sites.  

1.	https://ravenland.org and http://mypin.io/#/ .  These websites allow you to pin an IPFS file to a “Ravencoin” node for persistency.

    I would also like to see ideas to increase the support of the current nodes Ravenland has.  I believe this is important to the 
    legitimacy of real world use cases. 
    
2.	https://pocketraven.com .  Fully transparent multi-signature solution which works seamlessly offline and with other Ravencoin
clients.

    Honestly there are things here that I don’t fully comprehend the full use of.  
    
3.	https://www.mangofarmassets.com/ . Here you have the functions outlined at 
    https://github.com/MangoFarmAssets/rips/blob/master/rip-0011.mediawiki . The ability to encrypt a file and upload to IPFS. 
    Upload to IPFS a 2nd file (json file), encrypted with the receivers PGP public key, which contains the key and location of the 1st 
    encrypted file.  Then send asset to receiver that only receiver address can read and then use to unlock and read the 1st file.
    “Pirate messaging” a term coined by others.
    
All three of these sites have wallet functions.  Could this wallet attached to these and other websites so all function could be 
accessed from one address?

Could the multi-signature function be use at https://ravenx.net/  for lockup/escrow purposes when using he asset exchange?

Could the functions of these websites be accessed via AIPs rather than building the functions directly into the wallet?
